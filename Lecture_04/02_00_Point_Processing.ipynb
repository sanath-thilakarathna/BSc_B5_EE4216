    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Point processing** (also called **point operations** or **intensity transformations**) is the simplest form of spatial domain image processing where the output pixel value depends **only on the input pixel value** at that same location, independent of all other pixels."

    "### 1. Independence\n",
    "Each output pixel depends **only** on its corresponding input pixel:\n",
    "- No spatial relationships considered\n",
    "- Processing one pixel doesn't affect how we process another\n",
    "- Can be parallelized easily\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Memoryless\n",
    "The transformation is a simple mapping:\n",
    "$$s = T(r)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $r$ = input intensity (0-255 for 8-bit)\n",
    "- $s$ = output intensity (0-255 for 8-bit)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Lookup Table (LUT) Implementation\n",
    "Since there are only 256 possible input values (8-bit), we can pre-compute all transformations:\n",
    "```\n",
    "r  →  s\n",
    "0  →  T(0)\n",

    "- Image negative (for X-rays, films)\n",
    "- Highlight specific intensity ranges\n",
    "- Prepare images for further processing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Extremely fast** - $O(N)$ complexity where N = number of pixels\n",
    "- **Simple to implement** - Just a mathematical function\n",

    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- **No spatial context** - Cannot detect edges or patterns\n",
    "- **Cannot remove noise** - Noise removal requires neighborhood info\n",
    "- **Limited enhancement** - Cannot perform smoothing or sharpening\n",
    "- **Cannot detect edges** - Edge detection needs spatial derivatives"
