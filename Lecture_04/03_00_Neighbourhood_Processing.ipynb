    "## What is Neighbourhood Processing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neighbourhood processing** (also called **spatial filtering** or **local operations**) is a technique where the output pixel value depends not only on the pixel itself but also on the values of pixels in its **surrounding neighbourhood**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Difference from Point Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "| Point Processing | Neighbourhood Processing |\n",
    "|------------------|--------------------------|\n",
    "| Output depends on single input pixel | Output depends on multiple neighbouring pixels |\n",
    "| $s = T(r)$ | $s = T(\\text{neighbourhood})$ |\n",
    "| Example: s = ar + b | Example: averaging, smoothing, edge detection |\n",
    "| Fast, simple | More complex, powerful |\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Form\n",
    "\n",
    "For a pixel at position $(x, y)$, the output is computed using a neighbourhood centered at that pixel:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(x, y) = T[f(x-1, y-1), f(x-1, y), f(x-1, y+1), ..., f(x+1, y+1)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $f(x, y)$ = input image\n",
    "- $g(x, y)$ = output image\n",
    "- $T$ = transformation function operating on the neighbourhood\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Neighbourhood Sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **3×3 neighbourhood** (most common)\n",
    "   - 8 surrounding pixels + center pixel\n",
    "   - Small, fast, good for basic operations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **5×5 neighbourhood**\n",
    "   - 24 surrounding pixels + center pixel\n",
    "   - Better for stronger smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **7×7 or larger**\n",
    "   - More pixels involved\n",
    "   - Stronger effects but computationally expensive\n",

    "## Spatial Filtering Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial filtering** is the process of modifying pixel values based on the spatial relationship with their neighbours using a **filter** or **mask**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "The filtering process involves:\n",
    "1. Define a neighbourhood around each pixel\n",
